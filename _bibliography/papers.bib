  abstract  = {{State-of-the-art noisy-label learning algorithms rely on an unsupervised learning to classify training samples as clean or noisy, followed by a semi-supervised learning (SSL) that minimises the empirical vicinal risk using a labelled set formed by samples classified as clean, and an unlabelled set with samples classified as noisy. The classification accuracy of such noisy-label learning methods depends on the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples, and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We address these points with a new noisy-label training algorithm, called LongReMix, which improves the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets with a two-stage learning process. The stage one of LongReMix finds a small but precise high-confidence clean set, and stage two augments this high-confidence clean set with new clean samples and oversamples the clean data to increase the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We test LongReMix on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with introduced synthetic noisy labels, and the real-world noisy-label benchmarks CNWL (Red Mini-ImageNet), WebVision, Clothing1M, and Food101-N. The results show that our LongReMix produces significantly better classification accuracy than competing approaches, particularly in high noise rate problems. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in most datasets}},
